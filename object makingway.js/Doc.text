Object constructor:

The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor.
 Currently this approach is not recommended.
1.Object constructor:
var object = new Object();

2.Object's create method:

The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

var object = Object.create(null);

3.Object literal syntax:

The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

var object = {
     name: "Sudheer",
     age: 34
};

Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.x`

4 . Function constructor:

Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = 21;
}
var object = new Person("Sudheer");

5 . ) Function constructor with prototype:

This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

function Person() {}
Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
var object = new Person();
This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

function func() {};

new func(x, y, z);


6 . ) ES6 Class syntax:

ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

var object = new Person("Sudheer");

7 . ) Singleton pattern:

A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

var object = new (function () {
  this.name = "Sudheer";
})();

What is a prototype chain
Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. 
It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.
--------------------------------
What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind
The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one by one

Apply: Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

Creating JSON Data:
JSON data consists of key-value pairs. Keys are strings, and values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. 
Here's an example of JSON data representing a person's information:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  },
  "hobbies": ["reading", "swimming"]
}
